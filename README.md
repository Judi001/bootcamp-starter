### Together, We're Stronger 💪

Coding can be tough, but it's a lot easier when you're part of a supportive community. Here, you're not alone. Our community of learners, mentors, and fellow bootcamp members is here to help you every step of the way. Together, we'll conquer coding challenges and celebrate victories!

### Repo Structure 📁

Let's get familiar with the structure of this repository:

Projects: Inside the [projects directory](/projects/), you'll find folders for all your coding projects. Each project comes with its own set of instructions and resources.

Resources: The [resources directory](/resources/) contains helpful guides, and references to supercharge your learning.

### Getting Started 🚀

- Fork It

- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/bootcamp-starter.git
  ```

- Create a new branch for each project you're working on.

  ```sh
  git checkout -b project-1
  ```

- Commit your changes and push them to your fork.

  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Project 1 complete"
  git push origin project-1
  ```

- Merge your changes into the main branch in your fork.

  ```sh
  git checkout master
  git merge project-1
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a PR in the [Bootcamp-submissions]() repo at the end of each project

- Create a new branch for the next project and follow all the steps.

### **Don't Open PRs in this starter repo**

Remember, only open pull requests in the main branch of your fork if they are improvements to the starter template itself.
For project-specific PRs, create them in the respective project repositories.
