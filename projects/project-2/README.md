### Setup

- Create an `index.html` file
- Create a `styles.css` file
- Link your CSS file in the `<head>` of your HTML document
- Write your code

### Project objectives

- Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements.
- You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e., text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g., `<code>"Dr. Norman Borlaug"</code>`).
- You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`.
  - Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id` `<code>"image"</code>`.
  - Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id` `<code>"img-caption"</code>` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`.
- You should see an element with a corresponding `id` of `<code>"tribute-info"</code>`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
- You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id` of `<code>"tribute-link"</code>`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
  - HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab.
- Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
